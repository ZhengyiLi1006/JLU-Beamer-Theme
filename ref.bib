abstract = {Autonomous vehicles are heavily reliant upon their sensors to perfect the perception of surrounding environments, however, with the current state of technology, the data which a vehicle uses is confined to that from its own sensors. Data sharing between vehicles and/or edge servers is limited by the available network bandwidth and the stringent real-time constraints of autonomous driving applications. To address these issues, we propose a point cloud feature based cooperative perception framework (F-Cooper) for connected autonomous vehicles to achieve a better object detection precision. Not only will feature based data be sufficient for the training process, we also use the features' intrinsically small size to achieve real-time edge computing, without running the risk of congesting the network. Our experiment results show that by fusing features, we are able to achieve a better object detection result, around 10\% improvement for detection within 20 meters and 30\% for further distances, as well as achieve faster edge computing with a low communication delay, requiring 71 milliseconds in certain feature selections. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce feature-level data fusion to connected autonomous vehicles for the purpose of enhancing object detection and making real-time edge computing on inter-vehicle data feasible for autonomous vehicles.},
